# **Project Overview**

The Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) Policies Compliance System is a strategic initiative designed to protect brand integrity, ensure fair market competition, and enforce pricing discipline among resellers. This project aims to develop an automated, scalable, and intelligent system that monitors, detects, and enforces compliance with the client‚Äôs MAP policies across multiple online marketplaces.

Non-compliance with MAP policies can lead to significant risks, including price erosion, brand devaluation, and unfair competitive advantages for rogue resellers. To mitigate these risks, this system will proactively track advertised prices, identify violators‚Äîeven when they operate under different names across platforms‚Äîand apply graduated enforcement actions, including warnings and category suspensions.

## **Business Problem**
Brand owners and manufacturers often establish Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policies to maintain the perceived value of their products and prevent destructive price competition. However, enforcing these policies manually across numerous digital marketplaces is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

Currently, resellers may advertise products below the allowed threshold‚Äîspecifically below the Lowest Possible Price (LPP), which is derived from the MAP‚Äîunder different business names or storefronts on various platforms. Without a centralized system to link these identities and monitor pricing in real time, violations go undetected or are addressed too late, undermining brand equity and disadvantaging compliant partners.

This project addresses the need for:

- Automated monitoring of seller advertised prices (SAP) across e-commerce platforms.
- Accurate identification of resellers using name variations or alternate storefronts.
- Timely enforcement through standardized communication and corrective actions.
- A structured process to escalate consequences for repeated violations.

  ## **Project Objectives**
The primary objective of the MAP Compliance System is to automate the detection and enforcement of MAP policy violations, ensuring consistent adherence by all authorized resellers. 
Specific goals include:

- **Real-Time Price Monitoring**: Continuously scan major online marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Shopify stores) to collect advertised prices for each SKU.
- **Reseller Identity Mapping**: Use fuzzy matching and partial lookup algorithms to map seemingly distinct seller names across platforms to a single reseller entity (e.g., ‚ÄúSmart Place Store‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú7-Eleven‚Äù).
- **Violation Detection**: Compare Seller Advertised Prices (SAP) against the predefined LPP (typically set at 95% of MAP) to detect underpricing.
- **Automated Warning System**: Generate and send personalized warning letters to non-compliant resellers via email or integrated partner portals, referencing specific SKUs, dates, and violation details.
- **Enforcement Workflow**: Implement a tiered response mechanism where repeat offenders face progressive penalties, culminating in the suspension of product categories until compliance is restored.
- **Audit & Reporting**: Maintain a full audit trail of detected violations, communications sent, and enforcement actions taken for legal and operational review.

**System Workflow ‚Äì Example Scenario**
Consider the following real-world scenario illustrating how the system operates:

SKU: GT53XL
MAP: $100.00
LPP: $95.00 (i.e., 95% of MAP)
Reseller: 7-Eleven (operating as "Smart Place Store" on one platform)

- **Step 1: Monitoring**
The system crawls a major marketplace and detects that ‚ÄúSmart Place Store‚Äù is advertising SKU GT53XL at $90.00, which is below the LPP of $95.00.

- **Step 2: Reseller Mapping**
Using the internal reseller mapping database and fuzzy matching algorithms, the system identifies ‚ÄúSmart Place Store‚Äù as a storefront associated with the registered reseller 7-Eleven.

- **Step 3: Violation Alert & Action**
A violation record is created. The system automatically generates a formal Warning Letter (based on the template in Warning Letter.docx) addressed to 7-Eleven, detailing:

  The violating SKU and price
  The applicable MAP and LPP
  The date and location of detection
  A clear statement of policy breach
  Instructions for correction and consequences of future violations
  The letter is sent via email and logged in the compliance dashboard.

- **Step 4: Follow-Up Enforcement**
  If 7-Eleven continues to advertise GT53XL below $95.00 after a defined grace period, the system triggers the next level of enforcement:

   Category Suspension: All products within the same category (e.g., ‚ÄúPremium Ink Cartridges‚Äù) are suspended for 7-Eleven in the client‚Äôs distribution
   system, preventing further shipments or listings until compliance is verified.

 ## **Project Walkthrough**
 - **Step 1: Load Excel Files into SQLite Database**
   - Each input .xlsx file is loaded into a corresponding SQL table:
   - engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{DB_NAME}")
 - **Step 2: Detect Price Violations Using SQL**
   - query = """
     SELECT 
    SKU, PL, Category, Sub_category, seller_name, homologated_name,
    MAP_Price, LPP, Advertised_price, Violation_date
    FROM price_monitoring
    WHERE Advertised_price < LPP
    AND Violation_date IS NOT NULL
    """
    violations_df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
- **Step 3: Normalize Seller Names**
  - mapping_dict = dict(zip(mapping['SELLER_NAME'], mapping['HOMOLOGATED_NAME']))
    df['homologated_name'] = df['seller_name'].map(mapping_dict).fillna(df['homologated_name'])
- **Step 4: Generate Warning Letters with DocxTemplate**
   - Leverages docxtpl to populate a Word template (Warning Letter.docx) using context variables.
   - context = {
    'Date': datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
    'Reseller_Name': row['seller_name'],
    'Reseller_Company': row['homologated_name'],
    'Product_Name': f"{row['SKU']} ({row['Sub_category']})",
    'MAP_Price': f"${row['MAP_Price']:,.2f}",
    'Advertised_Price': f"${row['Advertised_price']:,.2f}",
    'Date_of_Violation': row['Violation_date'],
    'Platform': row['seller_name']
     }
     template.render(context)
     output_filename = f"WARNING_{safe_filename(row['homologated_name'])}_{row['SKU']}.docx"
     template.save(os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, output_filename))
- **Step 5: Flag Repeat Offenders for Suspension**
    - Uses SQL aggregation to detect chronic violators:
    - SELECT 
      homologated_name, 
      Category, 
      COUNT(*) AS violation_count
      FROM price_monitoring
      WHERE Advertised_price < LPP
      AND Violation_date IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY homologated_name, Category
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    -  Results are written back to the database:
    -  susp.to_sql("suspension_flagged", engine, if_exists="replace", index=False)
